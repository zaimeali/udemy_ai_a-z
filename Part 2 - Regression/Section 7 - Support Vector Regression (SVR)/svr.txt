Building a SVR:
	1. Collect a training set T = {X, Y}
	2. Choose a kernel and it's parameters as well as any regularization needed
	3. Form the correlation matrix, K which is vector
	4. Train your machine, exactly or approximately, to get contraction coefficients
	5. Use those coefficients, create your estimator f(X, a, x) = y*
	

In linear regression we are trying to minimize the error b/w the prediction and data.
In SVR our goal is to make sure that errors do not exceed the threshold.
	The Predictor lines that pass through error bars are drawn 
	and predictor lines that don't the lines that don't pass through those bars are not 
	acceptable bcz it means the diff of the distance
