Estimate in report is magnitude and magnitude is tricky in regressions.
as per example of MLR 
	RD Spend magnitude is higer than Marketing Spend where there are only two vars.
	units should be same if one var is in dollar so other var also should be in dollar not in cent
you cannot compare dollar with Kilo meters.[4:42] video 86
