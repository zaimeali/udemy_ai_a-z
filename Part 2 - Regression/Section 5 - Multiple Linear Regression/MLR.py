# Multiple Linear Regression

# y = b0 + b1*X1 + b2*X2+.....+bn*Xn

# Do not add all the dummy variables
# D2 = 1 - D1 
# Always omit one dummmy variable
# if it has 100 dummy variables include 99

# P-Value: is a statistical measure that helps scientists determine whether or not their hypotheses are correct
# P Values are used to determine whether the results of their experiment are within the normal range of values for 
# 	      the events being observed. 
# Usually, if the P value of a data set is below a certain pre-determined amount (like, for instance, 0.05), 
# 	scientists will reject the "null hypothesis" of their experiment - in other words, 
# 	they'll rule out the hypothesis that the variables of their experiment had no meaningful effect on the results

# The p-value is NOT the probability the claim is true.
# The p-value is NOT the probability the null hypothesis is true.
